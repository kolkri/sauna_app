I love ice swimming & sauna experience. That is why I wanted to build my own sauna web app project, where I can gather all finnish public saunas to one page. 

# Project features

The sauna web app will contain the following pages:

1. Frontpage: showing the saunas on the map (build with leaflet) and showing own sauna cards to each sauna

2. Dynamic single sauna page: Every sauna card in the front page leads to detail page, where user can find more details about each sauna

3. About page: Telling more about the project idea and sauna & ice swimming culture in Finland

# Chosen technologies

1. Backend: I will build the backend with MongoDB with the following database schema:  <br>

2. Frontend: I will build the frontned with Next.js (curious to try something new)

3. Testing: I will use cypress for testing
